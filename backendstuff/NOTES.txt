Notes on how to use Maven to compile my Java Code

$ mvn compile

This will compile the java code. Be sure to run this command in the same directory as the pom.xml file.

$ mvn package

This will package the java code into a JAR file. We can then use java to execute our java program.
Besure to run this command in the same dirrectory as the pom.xml file.

>> pom.xml

This file is important because it is the basic instructions on how maven will compile and build
the java code. Edit this file as you increase the scope of the program.

$ java -jar /target/*.jar

Maven will put our .jar files in the ~/target/ directory. We can use java to execute the .jars
